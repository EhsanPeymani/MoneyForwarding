# MoneyForwarding

This is the first challenge for the C# fundamental course at DevU.com

The idea is to creat a web form that receives the current value of money and calculates the future value given the number of years and the interest rate.

I used a ASP.NET project and made a very simple web form. 

The code validates your input to be able to parse them to double.
