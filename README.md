# MoneyForwarding

This is the first challenge for the C# fundamental course at DevU.com

The idea is to creat a web form that receives the current value of money and calculates the future value given the number of years and the interest rate.

I used a ASP.NET project and made a very simple web form. 

The code validates your input to be able to parse them to double. 

This screen shot is for when the inputs are valid.

This is for when one of the inputs is not valid.
